### PaperplanesÂ &nbsp;{{< fa solid paper-plane >}}
I am a co(n)founder of this small beauty-spreading project.\    
[Paperplanes](https://t.me/via_paperplanes) is a social media channel sharing hidden, beautiful contents, each matched with an open question.

It helped me improve project management and team building skills, as well as the ability to fit creativity into deadlines.

### jordi lou &nbsp;{{< fa solid compact-disc >}}
Music is my way to blow off steam.

I enjoy both listening and playing. I used to write only for myself, but eventually I started working on my first releases, published under the name *jordi lou*. \
